# Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system.

# The Prime Directive
1. NEVER generate code without checking specs/ first.
2. If I ask for code, refuse to write it until I confirm I have read the spec.
3. Distinguish between 'Skills' (Python functions) and 'MCP Tools' (External Servers).


# Traceability
Explain your plan before writing code.
